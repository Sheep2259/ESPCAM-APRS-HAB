things that need implementation

gps functionality
gps coords to aprs format

voltage measuring and reporting   DONE

wspr functions in radio.cpp possibly

implement Mixed radix encoding (like traquito big number encoding)

the following things must be transmitted periodically:
a range of packet lengths to test how many characters are usable,
packets with a wide veriaty of characters so we can tell which ones can be used for encoding,
packets in clusters, as in many consecutive transmission in a row to test large data thoughputs

not in this code but need aprs tracker website
